summary: >
    Super Mario World was the quintessential "console launch title".
    It took the popular Mario Bros. franchise, leveraged nearly every feature the
    Super Nintendo offered, yet never felt bloated nor like an exercise in
    box-checking.

## Introduction

I recently played through Super Mario World on the SNES again.  I'm not sure
exactly how many times I've played it in my life.  A few dozen times, at the
very least.  It was the first video game that I ever beat, and the first video 
game that I ever completed 100% of.  This site is titled "96 Exits" after the 
[speedrunning category](https://www.speedrun.com/smw?h=96_Exit) for Super Mario
World which requires runners to clear every one of the game's 96 intended exits
before beating Bowser and rescuing Princess Peach.
Clearing all 96 exits and getting the star icon to appear on my save
file was my first "gaming achievement".

I decided to start writing down and publishing some thoughts on gaming a
few weeks ago, after wrapping up this playthrough.  I immediately had second 
thoughts; what could I say to add to the discussion on Super Mario World?
I'm not a video games journalist.  I wasn't old enough when the game came out
to provide any deep insights into what it meant for the gaming industry or
gamers.

To resolve this, I decided I wouldn't make that the bar to meet in order to
publish.  This isn't meant to be a review, or deep analysis into Super Mario
World as a work of art, or its meaning in the context of video game history.
Some of that will inevitably be touched on, but it's not the goal.  Instead,
I'm just going to talk about Mario for a bit.

## Personal History

As mentioned, Super Mario World was the first game I beat when I was a kid.  I
can't remember exactly how old I was.  I remember where my family lived at the
time, so I can put an upper bound on it, and I remember a family friend's son
coached me on the best route through Bowser's Castle.  From best I can guess,
I was probably six years old, though I may have been five or seven.

My grandparents gave us a Super NES bundle for Christmas one year, I think it
was 1993 or 1994 from some SNES pack-in game carbon dating I've done.  We 
received the SNES bundle that came with Super Mario World and Mario Paint.  I'm 
assuming there weren't typically multiple Mario-related SNES bundles being sold 
at the same time, but I wasn't really old enough at the time for me to say with
any certainty.  In December 1994 Nintendo started bundling the "Super Mario
All-Stars + Super Mario World" compilation game with the SNES.  We didn't have
that one, so I'm guessing ours was purchased sometime in 1993 or 1994.

I played Super Mario World before ever playing Super Mario Bros. on the NES,
so some of the advances the former made were a little lost on me at the time.
Some of my earliest childhood memories are of waking up early on Saturday
mornings, well before my parents were awake, turning the volume way down 
on the 13" wood panel RCA TV we had set up in a corner for the SNES, and playing
Super Mario World until breakfast.

I never owned a Nintendo 64, so my only home console was the SNES right up
until the launch of the GameCube.  I remember we didn't unplug the SNES after
getting the GameCube, but I also know that it saw almost no use after that
point.  A big part of my recent interest in the SNES is realizing that there's
a whole bunch of games out there I would have *loved* to have been able to play
as a child, and they're not suddenly bad games.

## Super Mario World

Super Mario World begins by dropping the player, as Mario, immediately onto
a fork in the road.  I've always found this immediate choice you're given
to be an interesting one.  There are two directions you can take, either right
or left.  The right clearly eventually leads to a castle marked with a "1", a
literal signpost of where you're heading.  The left, on the other hand, leads...
somewhere?  The path looks like it will you off the screen itself into some
unknown area, which is an enticing hook.

start of a new game file"

I enjoyed both of these "first" levels, replaying them constantly, whether as
part of a fresh save file or just going back and running through them either
quickly or carefully.

The level on the left, "Yoshi's Island 1", is what I'd consider a classic
Mario-style "level 1-1".  It introduces the player to the game gently, but it
has some set pieces and gimmicks that work to really show off the new technology
and techniques the creators were able to leverage.

I listen to the [Retronauts podcast](https://retronauts.com/), and I know I've
heard Bob Mackey mention the "huge Bullet Bill" that explodes onto the screen
just a few seconds into Yoshi's Island 1 on at least three different episodes.

On the NES, sprites were either 8x8 or 8x16 pixels large, with the 16 pixel side
only available as the height, not the width.  When the NES would draw a frame to
the screen, it would do so one scanline (horizontal line) at a time, which is
also how analog video cables carry their signal.  
As each scanline was being prepared for
drawing, the PPU (Picture Processing Unit) would figure out which sprites needed
to be sourced from memory to render the current line, and load them into 
another specific
section of memory for "sprites on the current line".  This section of memory was
only large enough to hold eight sprites.  As a result, you will never have an
NES game with 8 visible sprites appearing on the same horizontal line of a
single frame.  Continuing this logic one step further, you will never have more
than 64 pixel's worth of sprites on a single horizontal line.

Banzai Bill's sprite is 64x64 pixels *itself*.  Only a few seconds into the game
and Nintendo has shown us something that would be literally impossible on its
previous system: Banzai Bill existing on the same horizontal line as Mario or
other characters.

There are some other neat tricks that Nintendo uses in this level. Diagonal
pipes are another instantly noticeable twist.

### Changing the World

Yoshi's Island 1 leads to the "Yellow Switch Palace" offscreen to the north.
The Switches in the Switch Palaces house giant colored versions of the P Switch
(or "Switch Block").  This first yellow one is "free", in the sense that the
player will naturally end up here by clearing levels in the normal fashion.
The rest of them (there are four in total) can only be found via secret exits.

Hitting these switches completes the level, takes us back to the world map,
and shows us an animation of dozens of color-matching blocks flying out from
our position, ostensibly going out and filling the world.  Super Mario Bros. 3
had an overworld, but the ability to permanently alter the state of the world
and the interior of levels themselves was brand new in Super Mario World.
