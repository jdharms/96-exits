# About

I'm Daniel, a thirty-something gamer in Columbus, Ohio.  I made this website
to have somewhere to jot down my thoughts on games and gaming, mostly so I can
have them somewhere in a concrete enough form to refer to later.

Currently I'm enjoying revisiting the back catalogs of Nintendo systems,
primarily the SNES, GBA, and GameCube.
